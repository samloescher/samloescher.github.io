Ludum dare is a community which hosts game jams every few months and normally fetches a few thousand entries (from all over the world). The jam is great fun, where people can either compete competitively over the 48 hours or take a more relaxed approach with 72 hours.

This time around, I worked with a close friend to create the entry. We ended up making a game about cats because cats are awesome and who doesn't like cats.

We really struggled with the theme on this one and it took much longer to think of a game idea that we would have liked. However overall the jam was a success; we scored top 10% for fun and we are pretty happy with how it went generally. In hindsight, we think we are going to try harder getting an idea quickly because we had to reduce the scope of what we could do due to taking extra time planning.

We used libGDX for the entry, which is an open source Java cross platform framework. This allowed us to deploy to desktop, android and web with the same source code. It was really cool and gave us an appreciation of packaging the final product to different platforms and some of the finer details that come with each platform.

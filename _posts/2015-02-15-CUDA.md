CUDA is a platform where you are able to write software for the GPU. This allows for significant compute resource when approaching data parallel problems. The largest domain people people often associate this with, and quite rightly so as in the name is graphics. The GPU allows for arbitrary functions to be applied across images per pixel, in parallel.

The course on Udacity is a great starting point if you want to learn about programming the GPU and has lots of problems sprinkled through the course to really enforce learning. The teaching is also great and many people approaching the subject come from a very sequential mindset, making the transition hard however the concepts are well taught making them easier to grasp. Many of the examples in the course use image processing problems from high dynamic ranging of images to image stitching.

While CUDA is NVidia proprietary software, much of what is learnt in CUDA can be translated to OpenCL as the concepts are the same, just a slight change in methodology. OpenCL also has to cater for multicore CPU and FPGA with the same code and comes out to be a lot more clunky when learning.

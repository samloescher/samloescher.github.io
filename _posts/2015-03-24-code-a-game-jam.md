This Jam was focused on development code first so tools such as Unreal and Unity were banned. The theme this time was Gemstones and after playing a lot of survival games, a gemstone miner stuck in a mine seemed to appear quickly in the brainstorming process. I was working with my brother in this Jam and we used XNA(C#) which neither of us had used before. It was pretty straight forward to use and overall a relatively pleasant experience albeit importing resources was a bit of a pain.

Overall this Jam was super fun and I learnt a lot. We came first and snagged some prizes for the effort. A big thanks goes to [Gerald McAlister](https://twitter.com/gemisisDev) for putting on the Jam by himself and sourcing the prizes!

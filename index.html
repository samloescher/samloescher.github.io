    <h1>faith</h1>
    <p>
        The most important person in my life is Jesus, which sounds a bit bonkers considering he walked on the earth over 2000 years ago. However it is rightfully so, Jesus made the way for everyone to have a relationship with the one true God. It's utterly incredible.

        <i>
            Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”

    <h1>books</h1>
    <p>
        I do a lot of reading, and it largely falls into two categories; Christian and Programming. However I do sometimes venture outside into the world of fiction and enjoyed <i>The Martian</i> recently.

        I started programming with Java which I learnt from O'Reilly's <i>Head First Java</i>. It was an excellent book which I would recommend to anyone picking up Java with little prior programming experience. It was through this book I picked up the foundations of Object Oriented design. The most influential programming book I have read since is <i>Clean Code</i> by Robert Cecil Martin. It covers a lot about a lot and sets the reader on an adventure of how to produce better and more maintainable code.

    <h1>career aspirations</h1>
    <p>
        I enjoy working on cutting edge technology, tackling technically hard problems. Much of what I find enjoyable is in the processes rather than the end product. In as much, I find often I prefer to be making things faster and more elegant, than quickly cobbled together prototypes.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a background in electronics and passion for software, I like to be working low down in the software stack.
    </p>

    <h1>hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        I enjoy watching programming videos and find myself watching videos outside my expertise so that I get a better appreciation as to why things are done the way they are. I particularly enjoy the content published by cppcon and ACCU, Kevlin Henney's talks on how write better, more maintainable code are  favourites of mine. Mike Acton did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">superb talk about Data Oriented design</a> which changed how I view laying out memory, with particular reference to the cache.
    </p>
    <p>
        To keep fit I enjoy bouldering and a bit of cycling. In my spare time I like to grow as many vegetables as I can, learn some new things at meetups, and maybe a bit more cycling!

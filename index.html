        I am currently a student at the University of Bath studying in my final year of MEng Electronic and Electrical
        Engineering. I hail from the green valleys in Devon, and from there I attribute much of my love for nature.

    <h1>faith</h1>
    <p>
        The most important person in my life is Jesus, which sounds a bit bonkers considering he walked on the earth
        over 2000 years ago. However it is rightfully so, Jesus made the way for everyone to have a relationship with
        the one true God. It's utterly incredible.

            Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” Jesus answered,
            “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know
            me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”
        </i>

    <h1>books</h1>
    <p>
        I do a lot of reading, and it largely falls into two categories; Christian and Programming. However I do
        sometimes venture outside into the world of fiction and enjoyed <i>The Martian</i> recently.

        I started programming with Java which I learnt from O'Reilly's <i>Head First Java</i>. It was an excellent book
        which I would recommend to anyone picking up Java with little prior programming experience. It was through this
        book I picked up the foundations of Object Oriented design. The most influential programming book I have read
        since is <i>Clean Code</i> by Robert Cecil Martin. It covers a lot about a lot and sets the reader on an
        adventure of how to produce better and more maintainable code.

    <h1>career aspirations</h1>
    <p>
        I currently look to be working in cutting edge of technology. Much of what I want to do conversely depends on
        how to get there, the processes rather than the end product. In as much I find often I prefer to be making
        things faster rather than initial product design.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that I will find myself working in embedded software, a sort of halfway house between electronics and
        software. The big concern for me however is the use of C++, or rather lack thereof.
        Much of embedded software today is still written in C, and while C is a very powerful tool there is sadly
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Sd8A6_fYU">quite a reluctance to change to C++</a>.
        Much of the time when I am writing C, I get frustrated at having to waste time dealing with things which the
        compiler can do for me, or even should be checking for me. The best thing about C++, is that when you let it,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDSvjwJ2M80">it can produce even better results than handwritten C</a>
        with abstractions which let you focus on the core problem.

    <h1>hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        I enjoy watching programming videos and find myself watching videos outside my expertise so that I get a better
        appreciation as to why things are done the way they are.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO">Jonathan Blow's videos</a>
        talking about Jai, a language written for game development have been really interesting. Mike Acton did a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">superb talk about Data Oriented design</a> which has sent
        me on a mission to always consider the cache, which most often is the bottleneck.
    </p>
    <p>
        I absolutely love solving problems, I find often when I have come across a hard problem I will think over it
        for days on end until I find a solution. Not just any solution mind, I am always striving to find the 'right'
        solution which I find most aesthetically pleasing, be it the simplest or the one which uses weird and wonderful
        ways of solving it.
